# What is a database?
- A collection of *related* objects. They must be related by some fact. For example, a collection of *students at uwf* would be a database of *people*
# How to create a database
- Specifying a database: documentaing what the database is supposed to contain and how to go about the overall design task itself
- Databases rely on the *waterfall* model commonly referenced with Software Engineering. Think before doing
- Elucidate (discuss), analyze, then specify
## Steps to follow
1. Requirements - Find out what the user wants
2. Specification - Gather and write down details including cost and time
	1. Feedback the specification to the user
	2. Redo the specification and repeat 2.1 if necessary
3. Design a database to meet the specification from step 2
	1. Check the design against the specification
4. Development - A contract is negotiated and development begins
	1. Software is tested against the design from step 3
5. Implementation - The finished product  is delivered to the user
	1. User tests the software
6. Maintenance - Make minor changes to support the database throughout its life
7. Retirement - Start all over once the database or software becomes obsolete
